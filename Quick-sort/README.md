<h2> Quick Sort</h2>
Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n). It works by recursively partitioning the array around a pivot element, sorting the two resulting sub-arrays, and then combining them. In addition, this implementation reads the input array from a file. The input file must contain one number per line, and the sorted output is printed to the console. The choice of pivot can affect the algorithm's performance, and in the worst case, it can have a time complexity of O(n^2). <br>
