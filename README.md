# C Algorithms and Data Structures
This project is a collection of C algorithms and data structures, including selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, divide and conquer, simple linked lists, doubly linked lists, binary search trees (BST), graph algorithms and traversals, and dynamic programming. These algorithms and data structures are implemented in C and designed to provide fast and reliable solutions for common programming problems.
