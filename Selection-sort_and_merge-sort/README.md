<h2>Selection Sort</h2> 
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm, which starts by finding the minimum element in an array and moving it to the first position. Then, the algorithm finds the second smallest element and moves it to the second position, and so on until the entire array is sorted. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). <br>

<h2>Merge Sort</h2>
Merge Sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm than Selection Sort, with a time complexity of O(n log n). It works by dividing the unsorted array into n subarrays, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merging subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until there is only one subarray remaining, which is the sorted array. The merging process involves comparing the elements in each subarray and inserting them into the sorted order. <br>
