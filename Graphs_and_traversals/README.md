<h2>BFS (Breadth-First Search)</h2> 
BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to the next level of nodes. This algorithm uses a queue data structure to keep track of the visited nodes and ensures that nodes are visited in increasing order of their distance from the root node. <br>

<h2>DFS (Depth-First Search)</h2>
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of the visited nodes and ensures that all nodes are visited before backtracking to the previous node. DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively.<br>
